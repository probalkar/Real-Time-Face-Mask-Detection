# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection
Created a real-time face mask detection system using OpenCV, Tensorflow, Streamlit and DeepFace to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. Additionally, it also estimates the person's age and gender for better demographic analysis of the people who do or do not prefer to wear mask.
